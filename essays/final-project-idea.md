## Overview

It is a known fact that good restaurants and bars usually have long wait times in many respects such as service response time, and it is also a terrible idea to keep hungry people waiting. Our mobile point of sales platform eliminates the waiting game for customers by automating the process and putting it online, so if you have a mobile device you never have to track down a waitress ever again. Furthermore as long as the customer has a debit card on their account they can pay for their services and tip and waitress without even reaching for their wallet. This makes the ordering process less daunting and more convenient for both patrons and the business establishment.  

## Approach



## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
> * Landing page 
> * Settings page 
> * Menu page 
> * Profile page 
> * Billing page 
> * Restaurant critique page

##Use case idea
Some user scenarios:
> * New users visiting the page for the first can either make an account or use the service without an account.
> * In the landing page they have the option to scan a QR code on their table or use the option to look up the restaurant manually. 
> * In the settings page the user can update their taste preferences such as salt level, spice level and special needs such as allergies.  
> * After the restaurant is identified, the menu page will be updated
> * The user have the option to go to the menu page and order at anytime 
> * The profile page will display some of the users favorite menu as well as their allergies 
> * The user can jump on the billing page to see the status of their order as well as what they had ordered so far. 
> * In the billing page users can also set spending limits, and request services from the wait staff.
> * Users can leave comments on the critique page. 

##Beyond the Basics  
  
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
> * Restaurant Suggestions based on previous orders using machine learning
> * Able to provide party hot spots based on number of people at restaurants or bars
> * Ratings and reviews for restaurants 
> * Give alerts for new menu items 
> * Suggest restaurants based on budgets
