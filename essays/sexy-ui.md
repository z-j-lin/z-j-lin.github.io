## IS IT WORTH LEARNING UI FRAMEWORKS?
UI Framesworks is a bunch of tools that help you make professional looking websites without putting in 
hours of work. There are a lot of free frameworks like Semantic UI that give you various types of tools
and some of them can be repetitive, so you should use something atleast once or twice so you know its available. The way I see it, the more tools you have in your trusty tool belt the better batman doesn't have just one tool in his belt.

## RAW HTML AND CSS

You can do a lot with HTML and CSS but would you rather do a lot to get the same result as someone who did very little? Making custom styling can get repetitive, confusing, and time consuming. If you were working at a real company as a UI developer you won't get paid more to take longer on a job that someone can do in a fraction of the time. 

Further more if you were working in a team, it will make it very difficult for your team members to decipher your code if you were working on a big project. With something like semantic UI you have an understandable descriptions of elements within their class that help you see what you are actually changing. I find that to be a very helpful tool because I can just remember the general types of words to use to make a certain container without to actually be specific about the orientation. This kind of allows you to make educated guesses to what you need to do to make a certain element. Its like how you would imagine a wizard would make up spells. 

##CAREER GOALS
If your career is in developing UIs then its beneficial to learn as much as possible. Being able to produce products faster and easier is good for your employer and yourself. Lets face it you don't to work too hard but you still wanna make money and your employer don't want to have to pay you too much because you worked too hard. So you do the only thing you can do which is work smarter!
