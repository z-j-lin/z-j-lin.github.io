Being able to learn a new language on the fly is a awesome super power. I found that I can learn new things using my previous experiences. For learning javascript I found that the syntax was very similar to C and the structure is similar to python. I found this out by doing example scripts on freecodecamp.org. 

Sometimes you already know how to do something but you just didn't know you could. Javascript is very similar to C, except you just dont declare any variable types. so if you know how to write a for loop in c you can most likely write one in javascript. After learning how to manipulate data in javascript I felt confident enough to tackle some real problems since doing example problems get brain melting boring. 

I find doing coding tutorials is very useful because you get to do the problem and understand it. I find that, the best way to learn is by doing. so by working through a problems you build on your experiences so that you can reflect back when you have a similar problem in the future. 

When you learn new techniques to run programs it is often best to approach the same problem multiple times. I find that your solution tends to evolve the first two or three times you do the problem. With javascript I found that there is usually more than one way to do something, and that there is "a solution" and then there is the "elegant solution".
