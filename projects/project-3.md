## Background
Computers do not have the ability to recognize handwritten digit because a computer sees handwriting as a collection of points. With machine learning we can turn the collection of points into a sample space that can be analyzed numerically to produce a prediction algorithm that can associate a certain set of points with a digit. Using a linear algebra a collection of points that made up a handwritten digit five can be turned into a matrix of points where we can generalize for a broad set of hand written fives that they belong to the digit 5. 
## What I learned
From doing this project I learned how to analyze data using linear algebra. I also learned how to model complex sets of problems using generalized properties of linear algebra.
